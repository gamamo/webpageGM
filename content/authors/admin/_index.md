I am a biologist with broad interest in several aspects of tropical ecology. Most of my experience has been working in tierra-firme (non-inundated) Amazonian forests in Brazil and in the eastern Andes of Ecuador, where I sampled understorey plants in more than 500 transects in collaboration with researchers from various universities. Currently I am living in Mexico, with my wife Mariana and my pets Pingo, Yuca and Sacha Mishi.
